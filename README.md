# CI2024_lab3

the problem was approached with an A* algorithm.
we initialize a random probem, then i start creating an initial greedy solution that is passed to a star.
the a star uses the manatthan distance as heuristics.
i initialize another manhattan distance function inside of the a star that does the same thing of the 
other function but it works on a dictionary to save computational time
